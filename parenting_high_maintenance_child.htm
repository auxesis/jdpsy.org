      Maintenance Children</span></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="3">Most 
      parents question their parenting success at times, usually more towards 
      the end of the day. It is amazing how a healthy six year old can be just 
      that age in the morning and only two or three by the end of the long and 
      hard parenting day. Regression is not a fancy psychological concept, it 
      happens every day in almost every household: children no longer act their 
      age and if the Parenting Peak-hours are really bad; neither do their 
      parents. These Parenting Peak-hours differ from one household to the next 
      but getting-the-kids-to-get-dressed-to-go-to-school, getting- 
      them-to-stop-fighting-with-each-other and 
      getting-them-to-do-their-homework must easily be near the top of the least 
      favourite parenting activities. Just as getting them to have a bath, eat 
      healthily and go to bed at a reasonable time is too. Some parents feel 
      that the Parenting Peak-hours never cease. &nbsp;</font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center"><b>
      <span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="3">The trouble with children</font></span></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="3">The 
      trouble with children is that they really are <i>highly unprofessional;</i> 
      they always let emotions get in the way of a sensibly planned parenting 
      working day. If only children would respond to our polite requests for 
      co-operation with: &quot;yes, of course Daddy, I'll do it immediately&quot; or 
      &quot;thank you for your wisdom Mother, it is really very late and of course I 
      should have been asleep by now&quot;. Children in general don't respond all 
      that positively to suggestions or instructions that are contrary to their 
      own plans. Often one hears about children who &quot;don’t listen&quot;, which on 
      closer inspection refers <i>not</i> to their auditory skills but to the 
      fact that they don’t choose to co-operate!! Interestingly the parental 
      presumption seems to be that as long as they decode our verbal 
      communications successfully, they will naturally comply with our 
      suggestions. The question is can we expect our children to always accept o<i>ur</i> 
      plans?&nbsp; It is <i>not</i> a child's ultimate fantasy to be co-operating 
      with his/her parents on a sensible basis. It is a parent's ultimate 
      fantasy that s/he does. </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="3">Often 
      we like to work with our children on a basis of mutual co-operation. This 
      is where we reach ‘agreements” with our children; they seem to consent to 
      go along with our sensibly formulated plans in a happy, quiet and 
      unthinking moment. Before they know it they have agreed to a deal that 
      when it comes to it, turns out to be only advantageous to the parent, like 
      go to bed on time or stop annoying your sister. Agreements in general are 
      only binding if ‘informed consent’ was secured. The younger the child the 
      more ‘informed’ consent is un-realistic.</font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="3">In 
      reality we need children sometimes to do as we tell them to without them 
      having the right to decline, gracefully or otherwise. How often are we 
      negotiating and arguing with them as we would with adults or colleagues, 
      meanwhile elevating children to a position of power that is exciting, 
      confusing and/or frightening to them all at the same time?</font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center"><b>
      <span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="3">Do you want to be friends 
      with your children?</font></span></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="3">Being 
      friends with our children is a privileged status we have to work hard for. 
      This status will only be achieved when they are still confiding in us 
      freely once they have their own family. Before that time we parents are in 
      charge of the children and we should be and being in charge is mutually 
      exclusive with being friends. Not putting ourselves in charge is like 
      driving across the Sydney </font></span><font size="3">
      <span style="font-family:

      Bridge in peak-hour and allowing our child to pull on the steering wheel,

      daddy really should be making the car change lanes.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center"><b>
      <span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="3">Parenting should be easy</font></span></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="3">It 
      would seem that parenting only feels right if we are able to do this in a 
      most comfortable and casual way. Each child borne ideally comes with a 
      tiny remote control for us to steer the child with if it goes ever so 
      slightly off course, because children ideally should only ever go slightly 
      off course……. Worse again is that we feel we are somehow failing in our 
      mission as a parent when we need to use other than subtle and nicely 
      positive techniques. &nbsp;</font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center"><b>
      <span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="3">Children’s and parents’ 
      privileges</font></span></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="3">Maybe 
      at times we are expecting too much of our children. Many books and 
      articles about Parenting are written in such a way that the ‘lay-parent’ 
      could be forgiven for thinking that it is ultimately possible to raise 
      children without ever witnessing tantrums, without ever having to raise 
      one’s voice, and that it is possible to never have to firmly grab hold of 
      your child in a heated exchange of words. Or …. if you find yourself using 
      any of these parenting methods, you should eternally feel guilty. The 
      truth is that it is a child's mission in life to go for what s/he can get. 
      We can't hold that against them. However it is a Parent's privilege in 
      life to remain sane under all that comes with this thing called parenting.
      </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-size:12.0pt;
  font-family:Arial">Some children can be raised with ease and how we parent 
      them seems to come naturally. Some children require a lot more energy, 
      patience and determination; high maintenance children. Some children 
      require a parenting style that is far removed from how we would prefer to 
      parent. A constant mixture of frustration, pain and guilt is felt because 
      how we want to parent doesn't seem to work and how we are required to 
      parent doesn’t feel good.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-size:12.0pt;
  font-family:Arial">Generally we can evaluate any child-parent relationship in 
      terms of the discrepancy between what I call the <i>Preferred Parenting 
      Style</i> (PPS) and the <i>Required Parenting Style<b><span style="font-variant:small-caps">
      </span></b></i><b><span style="font-variant:small-caps">(</span></b><span style="font-variant:small-caps">RPS)</span>. 
      The closer these styles the easier raising this child is experienced. The 
      further apart two things happen: the child is experienced as harder to 
      manage and the <i>Actual Parenting Style</i> (APS) will be far more 
      fluctuating, adding to the stress already felt by the parents. To be <i>
      consistent</i> in your parenting only works well with easy children. With 
      High Maintenance Children inconsistency is called flexible and creative 
      parenting. Some parents feel under great pressure trying to achieve 
      positive parenting fulfilment. In order not to compromise their Preferred 
      Parenting Style, they may not offer their child the (high) boundaries that 
      s/he needs. When this doesn't work and the parent has to be less 
      &quot;democratic&quot; than s/he prefers to be, the child can get blamed for this. 
      As in when the child displays unacceptable behaviour, s/he gets into 
      trouble for both the &quot;offence&quot; as well as the fact that the parent feels 
      upset because s/he needs (again!) to use a parenting style which is not 
      preferred.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-size:12.0pt;
  font-family:Arial">With High Maintenance children it is more important than 
      with &quot;other&quot; children that both parents agree on what the Required 
      Parenting Style is and that both parents will agree to act according to 
      the RPS. Parenting High Maintenance children can put a strain on the 
      marital relationship especially if the parents do not agree on the RPS. 
      One way of dealing with this is to set up a Required Parenting Plan which 
      states all the child's needs in terms of boundaries and rules and the 
      required parenting responses. When both parents can agree and act on this 
      plan the benefits will be great for everyone including the child 
      concerned. It is important to realise that parenting is not a level 
      playing field, it can’t be and it shouldn't be. Children depend on us for 
      their psychological security and that means not only love but boundaries 
      as well. </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="3">Don't 
      think that getting-to-school-on-time is only a meaningful experience if 
      the child has dressed him/herself, had breakfast, brushed his/her teeth 
      and is ready to go to school on time, all of this voluntarily and without 
      arguing with his/her siblings. </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="3">Don't 
      wait until such time that your child ‘<i>provokes’</i> you to blow up. If 
      it is necessary to be intentional, directive and you feel you have to skip 
      the niceties, so be it, and after all you are in charge. When you blow up 
      when you <i>decide</i> to, you will find that it will be far less intense 
      because you will stop blaming your child for your own outburst. And it 
      will be a far less painful experience for everyone involved.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="3">
      Remember, the more you place yourself in charge, the more secure your 
      children will feel. It is a safe feeling to know that your parents can 
      manage anything you might throw at them! Or at least look like they can! 
      When it is time to set <i>boundaries </i>be decisive and when it is time 
      for <i>love</i> and affection spoil them. But don't mix the two!</font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="3">
      Children are the most important assets one can ever dream to have. A 
      non-punitive, leading-from-the-front style of parenting has the best 
      chance to succeed with raising High Maintenance children.</font></span></p>
