## Jeroenâ€™s approach to assessments

Jeroen's approach will be helpful if the purpose of a diagnosis is to develop a better understanding for the client and their family.
The assessment process is collaborative.
The first appointment is an initial clinical interview with Jeroen.
He will discuss with you the likelihood of a diagnosis.
It can be very beneficial to have family or friends at the initial sessions.
This process generally takes between 2 to 4 sessions.

**If a subsequent report is required, a fee is applicable.**

    <p>
      Please note: Jeroen does not have gold standard assessment tools such the <abbr title="Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule" class="initialism">ADOS</abbr> or <abbr title="Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised" class="initialism">ADI-R</abbr>.
      His focus is on providing treatment, thus only limited assessment services are available.
      If a diagnosis is to be used in legal or other official matters, it may be best to seek a more rigorous assessment than what Jeroen can offer.
      Jeroen can recommend colleagues who do offer comprehensive assessments.
