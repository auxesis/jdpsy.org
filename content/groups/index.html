    ‘WereldVreemd’ is a Dutch word used to explain how some people can experience themselves as foreign (vreemd) to the world (wereld) and vice versa.

The aim of this psychoeducational group is to provide mutual understanding as well as skills training in a supportive environment.
The monthly WereldVreemd group started in June 2009 and is now in its 12th year.
For the first two and half years only men attended.
Currently the group is pretty much 50-50 in terms of male-female attendance.
This may be so because women on the spectrum are now more easily diagnosed than even 10 years ago.
Research has shown recently that women on the spectrum generally show a level of social skills typical of man not on the spectrum.
That would be harder to diagnose for clinicians not familiar with the autism spectrum.

It is well established that there are several potential benefits to be gained from receiving an ASD diagnosis including increased self-understanding and a more realistic and therefore more purposeful self-perception: as one of the people in the group once phrased it: “ASD explains ‘me’ to me best”.

The element of comparing notes is highly regarded.
It makes sense that people on the spectrum would want to learn from others on the spectrum who have successfully manoeuvred through difficult social situations.
I am very pleased to see that this group is providing an answer for men and women on the spectrum and I will continue to provide this service to the neurodiverse community under COVIDSafe conditions.

## How the group works

- **Attendance is by invitation only.**
- **Partners, family or support people do not attend.**
- **An assessment interview is required before invitation.**

To ensure we comply with COVIDSafe protocols, the WereldVreemd Group has moved online via Zoom Pro one Saturday per month.
The group has on average 10 participants per session.
