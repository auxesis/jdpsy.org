    ‘WereldVreemd’ is a Dutch word used to explain how some people can experience themselves as foreign (vreemd) to the world (wereld) and vice versa.

The aim of this psychoeducational group is to provide mutual understanding as well as skills training in a supportive environment. 
The monthly WereldVreemd group started in June 2009 and is now in its 14th year. For the first two and half years only men attended. 
Currently the group is pretty much 50-50 in terms of male-female attendance.
<p>
It is well established that there are several potential benefits to be gained from a deeper understanding of 
Neurodivergence including increased self-understanding and a more realistic and therefore more purposeful self-perception.
<p>
One of the participants in the group once phrased it: “Neurodivergence explains ‘me’ to me best”.
<p>
Comparing narratives and journeys is highly regarded amongst the participants. 
It makes sense that Neurodivergent people would want to learn from other Neurodivergence 
People who have successfully manoeuvred through difficult social situations.
