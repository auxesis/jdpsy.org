## Referrals

**You do NOT need a referral to see a Psychologist.**

However, with an appropriate referral you may be able to claim a Medicare rebate [under the Better Access Initiative](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/betteraccess_factsheet_for_patients). The Better Access Initiative allows for 10 (6+4) sessions. Another 10 COVID sessions were made available by the government in 2020.

In order for Medicare to process your claim the referral letter must have the following:

* Patient’s name, address, date of birth
* Mental health diagnosis - for example anxiety, depression.
* Addressed to a named Psychologist or ‘The Psychologist’
* GP referrals only: Make mention of or include a Mental Health Care Plan.
* Number of appointments requested.

## Telehealth

Jeroen’s preference is Telehealth consultations. The benefit of telehealth is that you can talk to Jeroen from the comfort of your own home without the need for a facemask.

## COVIDSafe face to face sessions

Face to face sessions are only available on a limited basis. A mask must be worn at all times. Hand sanitiser is available upon arrival and social distancing is to be observed. The address is:
