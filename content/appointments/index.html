## Referrals

**You do NOT need a referral to see a Psychologist.**
{{% /md %}}

<p>
  However, with an appropriate referral you may be able to claim a Medicare rebate <a href="https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/betteraccess_factsheet_for_patients" target="_blank">under the Better Access Initiative</a>.
  The Better Access Initiative allows for 10 (6+4) sessions.
  Another 10 COVID sessions were made available by the government in 2020.
</p>

{{% md %}}
In order for Medicare to process your claim the referral letter must have the following:

* Patient’s name, address, date of birth
* Mental health diagnosis - for example anxiety, depression.
* Addressed to a named Psychologist or ‘The Psychologist’
* GP referrals only: Make mention of or include a Mental Health Care Plan.
* Number of appointments requested.

## Telehealth

Jeroen’s preference is Telehealth consultations.
The benefit of telehealth is that you can talk to Jeroen from the comfort of your own home without the need for a facemask.

## COVIDSafe face to face sessions
