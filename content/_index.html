      Jeroen specialises in psychological therapies for people on the Autism Spectrum.
      The focus of treatment is life skills and strategies for managing day to day situations.
      Jeroen likes to include family in the therapeutic process.
      Partners, family and or close friends are encouraged to attend the first session at least.

          Face masks must be worn during face-to-face sessions. The main benefit of online sessions is no facemasks.
