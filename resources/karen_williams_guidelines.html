Children diagnosed with Asperger syndrome present a special challenge in the educational
milieu.  This article provides teachers with descriptions of seven defining
characteristics of Asperger syndrome, in addition to suggestions and strategies for 
addressing these symptoms in the classroom.  Behavioral and academic interventions based
on the author's teaching experiences with children with Asperger syndrome are offered.

Children diagnosed with Asperger syndrome (AS; see Note) present a special challenge in
the educational milieu.  Typically viewed as eccentric and peculiar by classmates, their
inept social skills often cause them to be made victims of scapegoating.  Clumsiness and
an obsessive interest in obscure subjects add to their "odd" presentation.  Children with
AS lack understanding of human relationships and the rules of social convention; they are
naive and conspicuously lacking in common sense.  Their inflexibility and inability to
cope with change causes these individuals to be easily stressed and emotionally
vulnerable.  At the same time, children with AS (the majority of whom are boys) are 
often of average to above-average intelligence and have superior rote memories. Their
single-minded pursuit of their interests can lead to great achievements later in life.
</font></p><p>
<font font="" face="arial" size="2">Asperger syndrome is considered a disorder at the higher end of the autistic continuum.
Comparing individuals within this continuum, Van Krevelen (cited in Wing, l99l) noted
that the low-functioning child with autism "lives in a world of his own," whereas the
higher functioning child with autism "lives in our world but in his own way" (p.99).
</font></p><p>
<font font="" face="arial" size="2">Naturally, not all children with AS are alike.  Just as each child with AS has his or
her own unique personality, "typical" AS symptoms are manifested in ways specific to 
each individual.  As a result, there is no exact recipe for classroom approaches that
can be provided for every youngster with AS, just as no one educational method fits the
needs of all children not afflicted with AS.
</font></p><p>
<font font="" face="arial" size="2">Following are descriptions of seven defining characteristics of Asperger syndrome, 
followed by suggestions and classroom strategies for addressing these symptoms.
(Classroom interventions are illustrated with examples from my own teaching experiences
at the University of Michigan Medical Center Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Hospital
School.) These suggestions are offered only in the broadest sense and should be tailored
to the unique needs of the individual student with AS.

<h3>Insistence on Sameness</h3>
</font><font font="" face="arial" size="2">

Children with AS are easily overwhelmed by minimal change, are highly sensitive to
environmental stressors, and sometimes engage in rituals. They are anxious and tend to
worry obsessively when they do not know what to expect; stress, fatigue and sensory
overload easily throw them off balance.
</font>
<p></p><p>
</p><font font="" face="arial" size="2">
<h4>Programming Suggestions</h4>
</font><font font="" face="arial" size="2">
</font><p></p><ul>
<font font="" face="arial" size="2"><li>Provide a predictable and safe environment;
<p>
</p></li><li>Minimize transitions;
<p>
</p></li><li>Offer consistent daily routine: The child with AS must understand each day's
routine and know what to expect in order to be able to concentrate on the task at hand;
<p>
</p></li><li>Avoid surprises:  Prepare the child thoroughly and in advance for special activities,
altered schedules, or  any  other change in routine, regardless of how minimal;
<p>
</p></li><li>Allay fears of the unknown by exposing the child to the new activity, teacher, class,
school, camp and so forth beforehand, and as soon as possible after he or she is informed
of the change, to prevent obsessive worrying. (For instance, when the child with AS must
change schools, he or she should meet the new teacher, tour the new school and
be apprised of his or her routine in advance of actual attendance.  School assignments 
from the old school might be provided the first few days so that the routine is familiar
to the child in the new environment.  The receiving teacher might find out the child's
special areas of interest and have related books or activities available on the child's
first day.)</li></font>

<h3>Impairment in Social Interaction</h3>
</font>
<font font="" face="arial" size="2">
Children with AS show an inability to understand complex rules of social interaction;  
are naive; are extremely egocentric; may not like physical contact; talk at
people instead of to them; do not understand jokes, irony or metaphors; use monotone
or stilted, unnatural tone of voice; use inappropriate gaze and body language; are 
insensitive and lack tact; misinterpret social cues; cannot judge "social distance;"
exhibit poor ability to initiate and sustain conversation; have well-developed speech
but poor communication; are sometimes labeled "little professor" because speaking style
is so adult-like and pedantic; are easily taken advantage of (do not perceive that others
sometimes lie or trick them); and usually have a desire to be part of the social world.
</font><p></p><p>

</p><font font="" face="arial" size="2">
<h4>Programming Suggestions</h4>
</font>
<p></p><ul>
<font font="" face="arial" size="2">
<li>Protect the child from bullying and teasing;
<p>
</p></li><li>In the higher age groups, attempt to educate peers about the child with AS when
social ineptness is severe by describing his or her social problems as a true disability.
Praise classmates when they treat him or her with compassion.  This task may prevent
scapegoating, while promoting empathy and tolerance in the other children;
<p>
</p></li><li>Emphasize the proficient academic skills of the child with AS by creating cooperative
learning situations in which his or her reading skills, vocabulary, memory and so forth
will be viewed as an asset by peers, thereby engendering acceptance;
<p>
</p></li><li>Most children with AS want friends but simply do not know how to interact.  They
should be </li></font><font font="" face="arial" size="2">  taught </font>
<font font="" face="arial" size="2">
  how to react to social cues and be given repertoires of responses
to use in various social situations.  Teach the children what to say and how to say it.
Model two-way interactions and let them role-play.  These children's social judgment
improves only after they have been taught rules that others pick up intuitively.  One
adult with AS noted that he had learned to "ape human behavior."  A college professor 
with AS remarked that her quest to understand human interactions made her "feel like an
anthropologist from Mars" (Sacks, l993, p.112);
</font><p>
</p><font font="" face="arial" size="2"><li>Although they lack personal understanding of the emotions of others, children with
AS can</li></font>
<font font="" face="arial" size="2"> 
learn
</font><font font="" face="arial" size="2">
 the correct way to respond.  When they have been unintentionally
insulting, tactless or insenstive, it must be explained to them why the response was
inappropriate and what response would have been correct.  Individuals with AS must learn
social skills intellectually:  They lack social instinct and intuition;
</font><p>
</p><font font="" face="arial" size="2"><li>Older students with AS might benefit from a "buddy system."  The teacher
can educate a sensitive nondisabled classmate about the situation of the child with AS 
and seat them next to each other.  The classmate could look out for the child with AS
on the bus, during recess, in the hallways and so forth, and attempt to include him or
her in school activities.
<p>
</p></li><li>Children with AS tend to be reclusive; thus the teacher must foster involvement with
others.  Encourage active socialization and limit time spent in isolated pursuit of
interests.  For instance, a teacher's aide seated at the lunch table could actively
encourage the child with AS to participate in the conversation of his or her peers not
only by soliciting his or her opinions and asking him questions, but also by subtly
reinforcing other children who do the same.
</li></font></ul>

<p>
</p><hr />
<p>
</p><font face="arial">
<h3>Restricted Range of Interests</h3>
</font>
<font font="" face="arial" size="2">
Children with AS have eccentric preoccupations or odd, intense fixations (sometimes
obsessively collecting unusual things).  They tend to relentlessly "lecture"
on areas of interest; ask repetitive questions about interests; have trouble letting go
of ideas; follow own inclinations regardless of external demands; and sometimes refuse
to learn about anything outside their limited field of interest.
</font><p></p><p>

</p><font font="" face="arial" size="2">
<h4>Programming Suggestions</h4>
</font>
<p></p><ul>
<font font="" face="arial" size="2">

<li>Do not allow the child with AS to perseveratively discuss or ask questions about
isolated interests.  Limit this behavior by designating a specific time during the day
when the child can talk about this.  For example:  A child with AS who was fixated on
animals and had innumerable questions about a class pet turtle knew that he was allowed
to ask these questions only during recesses.  This was part of his daily routine and 
he quickly learned to stop himself when he begain asking these kinds of questions at
other times of the day;
<p>
</p></li><li>Use of positive reinforcement selectively directed to shape a desired behavior is
the critical strategy for helping the child with AS (Dewey, 1991).  These children 
respond to compliments (e.g., in the case of a relentless question-asker, the teacher
might consistently praise him as soon as he pauses and congratulate him for allowing
others to speak).  These children should also be praised for simple, expected social
behavior that is taken for granted in other children;
<p>
</p></li><li>Some children with AS will not want to do assignments outside their area of interest.
</li></font><font font="" face="arial" size="2">
Firm expectations
</font><font font="" face="arial" size="2">
 must be set for completion of classwork.  It must be made very
clear to the child with AS that he is not in control and that he must follow specific 
rules.  At the same time, however, meet the children halfway by giving them opportunitites
to pursue their own interests;
</font><p>
</p><font font="" face="arial" size="2"><li>For particularly recalcitrant children, it may be necessary to initially 
individualize all assignments around their interest area (e.g., if the interest is
dinosaurs, then offer grammar sentences, math word problems and reading and spelling
tasks about dinosaurs).  Gradually introduce other topics into assignments;
<p>
</p></li><li>Students can be given assignments that link their interest to the subject being
studied.  For example, during a social studies unit about a specific country, a child
obsessed with trains might be assigned to research the modes of transportation used by
people in that country;
<p>
</p></li><li>Use the child's fixation as a way to broaden his or her repertoire of interests.
For instance, during a unit on rain forests, the student with AS who was obsessed with
animals was led to not only study rain forest animals but to also study the forest 
itself, as this was the animals' home.  He was then motivated to learn about the local 
people who were forced to chop down the animals' forest habitat in order to survive.
</li></font></ul>
<p>
</p><hr />
<p>

</p><font face="arial">
<h3>Poor Concentration</h3>
</font>
<font font="" face="arial" size="2">

Children with AS are often off task, distracted by internal stimuli; are very disorganized;
have difficulty sustaining focus on classroom activities (often it is not that the attention
is poor but, rather, that the focus is "odd" ; the individual with AS cannot figure
out what is relevant [Happe, 1991], so attention is focused on irrelevant stimuli); tend to
withdrawl into complex inner worlds in a manner much more intense than is typical of 
daydreaming and have difficulty learning in a group situation.
</font>

<p></p><p>
</p><font face="arial">
<h4>Programming Suggestions</h4>
</font>
<p></p><ul>
<font font="" face="arial" size="2">
<li>A tremendous amount of regimented external structure must be provided if the child with
AS is to be productive in the classroom.  Assignments should be broken down into small units,
and frequent teacher feedback and redirection should be offered;
<p>
</p></li><li>Children with severe concentration problems benefit from timed work sessions.  This
helps them organize themselves.  Classwork that is not completed within the time limit (or that
is done carelessly) within the time limit must be made up during the child's own time (i.e.,
during recess or during the time used for pursuit of special interests).  Children with AS
can sometimes be stubborn; they need firm expectations and a structured program that teaches
them that compliance with rules leads to positive reinforcement (this kind of program 
motivates the child with AS to be productive, thus enhancing self-esteem and lowering stress
levels, because the child sees himself as competent);
<p>
</p></li><li>In the case of mainstreamed students with AS, poor concentration, slow clerical speed and
severe disorganization may make it necessary to lessen his or her homework/classwork load
and/or provide time in a resource room where a special education teacher can provide the 
additional structure the child needs to complete classwork and homework (some children
with AS are so unable to concentrate that it places undue stress on parents to expect that
they spend hours each night trying to get through homework with their child);
<p>
</p></li><li>Seat the child with AS at the front of the class and direct frequent questions to him or
her to help him or her attend to the lesson;
<p>
</p></li><li>Work out a nonverbal signal with the child (e.g., a gentle pat on the shoulder) for times
when he or she is not attending;
<p>
</p></li><li>If a buddy system is used, sit the child's buddy next to him or her so the buddy can 
remind the child with AS to return to task or listen to the lesson;
<p>
</p></li><li>The teacher must actively encourage the child with AS to leave his or her inner thoughts/
fantasies behind and refocus on the real world.  This is a constant battle, as the comfort of
that inner world is believed to be much more attrative than anything in real life.  For young
children, even free play needs to be structured, because they can become so immersed in
solitary, ritualized fantasy play that they lose touch with reality.  Encouraging a child with
AS to play a board game with one or two others under close supervision not only structures
play but offers an opportunity to practice social skills.

<p>
</p><hr />
<p>
</p><font font="" face="arial" size="2">
<h3>Poor Motor Coordination</h3>
</font><font font="" face="arial" size="2">

Children with AS are physically clumsy and awkward; have stiff, awkward gaits; are unsuccessful
in games involving motor skills; and experience fine-motor deficits that can cause penmanship
problems, slow clerical speed and affect their ability to draw.
</font>
<p></p><p>
</p><font font="" face="arial" size="2">
<h4>Programming Suggestions</h4>
</font><font font="" face="arial" size="2">
</font><p></p><ul>
<font font="" face="arial" size="2"><li>Refer the child with AS for adaptive physical education program if gross motor problems
are severe;
<p>
</p></li><li>Involve the child with AS in a health/fitness curriculum in physical education, rather than
in a competitive sports program;
<p>
</p></li><li>Do not push the child to participate in competitive sports, as his or her poor motor
coordination may only invite frustration and the teasing of team members. The child with AS
lacks the social understanding of coordinating one's own actions with those of others on a 
team;
<p>
</p></li><li>Children with AS may require a highly individualized cursive program that entails tracing
and copying on paper, coupled with motor patterning on the blackboard.  The teacher guides the
child's hand repeatedly through the formation of letters and letter connections and also uses
a verbal script.  Once the child commits the script to memory, he or she can talk himself or
herself through letter formations independently;
<p>
</p></li><li>Younger children with AS benefit from guidelines drawn on paper that help them control 
the size and uniformity of the letters they write.  This also forces them to take the time to
write carefully;
<p>
</p></li><li>When assigning timed units of work, make sure the child's slower writing speed is taken 
into account;
<p>
</p></li><li>Individuals with AS may need more than their peers to complete exams (taking exams in the
resource room not only offer more time but would also provide the added structure and teacher
redirection these children need to focus on the task at hand).
</li></font></ul>
<p>
</p><hr />

<p>
</p><font font="" face="arial" size="2">
<h3>Academic Difficulties</h3>
</font> <font font="" face="arial" size="2">
Children with AS usually have average to above-average intelligence (especially in the verbal
sphere) but lack high level thinking and comprehension skills.  They tend to be very 
literal:  Their images are concrete, and abstraction is poor.  Their pedantic speaking style
and impressive vocabularies give the false impression that they understand what they are 
talking about, when in reality they are merely parroting what they have heard or read.  The
child with AS frequently has an excellent rote memory, but it is mechanical in nature; that
is, the child may repond like a video that plays in set sequence.  Problem-solving skills are
poor.
</font><p></p><p>

</p><font font="" face="arial" size="2">
<h4>Programming Suggestions</h4>
</font>
<font font="" face="arial" size="2">
</font><p></p><ul>
<font font="" face="arial" size="2"><li>Provide a highly individualized academic program engineered to offer consistant
successes.  The child with AS needs great motivation to not follow his or her own
impulses.  Learning must be rewarding and not anxiety-provoking;
<p>
</p></li><li>Do not assume that children with AS understand something just because they parrot back
what they have heard;
<p>
</p></li><li>Offer added explanation and try to simplify when lesson concepts are abstract;
<p>
</p></li><li>Captialize on these individuals' exceptional memory:  Retaining factual information
is frequently their forte;
<p>
</p></li><li>Emotional nuances, multiple levels of meaning, and relationship issues as presented
in novels will often not be understood;
<p>
</p></li><li>The writing assignments of individuals with AS are often repetitious, flit from one 
subject to the next, and contain incorrect word connotations.  These children frequently
do not know the difference between general knowledge and personal ideas and therefore assume
the teacher will understand their sometimes abstruse expressions;
<p>
</p></li><li>Children with AS often have excellent reading recognition skills, but language 
comprehension is weak.  Do not assume they understand what they so fluently read;
<p>
</p></li><li>Academic work may be of poor quality because the child with AS is not motivated to
exert effort in areas in which he or she is not interested. Very firm expectations must be
set for the </li></font><font font="" face="arial" size="2">quality</font><font font="" face="arial" size="2"> of work produced.  Work executed within timed periods must be not
only complete but done carefully.  The child with AS should be expected to correct poorly 
executed classwork during recess or during the time he or she usually pursues his or her own
interests.</font>
</ul>
<p>
</p><hr />

</p><font font="" face="arial" size="2">
<h3>Emotional Vulnerability</h3>
</font>
<font font="" face="arial" size="2">
Children with Asperger Syndrome have the intelligence to compete in regular education but
they often do not have the emotional resources to cope with the demands of the classroom.
These children are easily stressed due to their inflexibility.  Self-esteeem is low, and they
are often very self-critical and unable to tolerate making mistakes.  Individuals with AS,
especially adolescents, may be prone to depression (a high percentage of depression in adults
with AS has been documented). Rage reactions/temper outbursts are common in response to 
stress/frustration.  Children with AS rarely seem relaxed and are easily overwhelmed when
things are not as their rigid views dicate they should be.  Interacting with people and coping
with the ordinary demands of everyday life take continual Herculean effort.
</font>
<p></p><p>
</p><font font="" face="arial" size="2">
<h4>Programming Suggestions</h4>
</font>
<p></p><ul>
<font font="" face="arial" size="2">
<li>Prevent outbursts by offering a high level of consistency.  Prepare these children
for changes in daily routine, to lower stress (see "Resistance to Change" section).
Children with AS frequently become fearful, angry, and upset in the face of forced or
unexpected changes;
<p>
</p></li><li>Teach the children how to cope when stress overwhelms him or her, to prevent 
outbursts.  Help the child write a list of very concrete steps that can be followed when
he or she becomes upset (e.g., 1-Breathe deeply three times; 2-Count the fingers on your
right hand slowly three times; 3-Ask to see the special education teacher, etc.). 
Include a ritualized behavior that the child finds comforting on the list.  Write these
steps on a card that is placed in the child's pocket so that they are always readily
available;
<p>
</p></li><li>Affect as reflected in the teacher's voice should be kept to a minimum.  Be calm,
predictable, and matter-of-fact in interactions with the child with AS, while clearly
indicating compassion and patience.  Hans Asperger (1991), the psychiatrist for whom
this syndrome is named, remarked that "the teacher who does not understand that it is
necessary to teach children [with AS] seemingly obvious things will feel impatient and
irritated" (p.57); Do not expect the child with AS to acknowledge that he or she is sad/
depressed.  In the same way that they cannot perceive the feelings of others, these 
children can also be unaware of their own feelings.  They often cover up their
depression and deny its symptoms;
<p>
</p></li><li>Teachers must be alert to changes in behavior that may indicate depression, such
as even greater levels of disorganization, inattentiveness, and isolation; decreased
stress threshold; chronic fatigure; crying; suicidal remarks; and so on.  Do not
accept the child's assessment in these cases that he or she is "OK"
<p>
</p></li><li>Report symptoms to the child's therapist or make a mental health referral so that 
the child can be evaluated for depression and receive treatment if this is needed.
Because these children are often unable to assess their own emotions and cannot seek
comfort from others, it is critical that depression be diagnosed quickly;
<p>
</p></li><li>Be aware that adolescents with AS are especially prone to depression.  Social skills
are highly valued in adolescence and the student with AS realizes he or she is different
and has difficulty forming normal relationships.  Academic work often becomes more abstract,
and the adolescent with AS finds assignments more difficult and complex.  In one case,
teachers noted that an adolescent with AS was no longer crying over math assignments
and therefore believed that he was coping much better.  In reality, his subsequent 
descreased organization and productivity in math was believed to be function of his 
escaping further into his inner world to avoid the math, and thus he was not coping well
at all;
<p>
</p></li><li>It is critical that adolescents with AS who are mainstreamed have an identified support
staff member with whom they can check in at least once daily.  This person can assess how
well he or she is coping by meeting with him or her daily and gathering observations from
other teachers;
<p>
</p></li><li>Children with AS must receive academic assistance as soon as difficulties in a
particular area are noted.  These children are quickly overwhelmed and react much more
severely to failure than do other children;
<p>
</p></li><li>Children with AS who are very fragile emotionally may need placement in a highly
structured special education classroom that can offer individualized academic program.
These children require a learning environment in which they see themselves as competent
and productive.  Accordingly, keeping them in the mainstream, where they cannot grasp
concepts or complete assignments, serves only to lower their self-concept, increase 
their withdrawl, and set the stage for a depressive disorder.  (In some situations, a
personal aide can be assigned to the child with AS rather than special education 
placement.  The aide offers affective support, structure and consistent feedback.)
</li></font></ul>
<p>
</p><hr />
<p>
<font font="" face="arial" size="2">Children with Asperger's syndrome are so easily overwhelmed by environmental stressors,
and have such profound impairment in the ability to form interpersonal relationships,
that it is no wonder they give the impression of "fragile vulnerability and a
pathetic childishness" (Wing, 1981, p. 117). Everard (1976)wrote that when these
youngsters are compared with their nondisabled peers, "one is instantly aware of 
how different they are and the enormous effort they have to make to live in a world where
no concessions are made and where they are expected to conform" (p.2).
</font></p><p>
<font font="" face="arial" size="2">Teachers can play a vital role in helping children with AS learn to negotiate the world
around them.  Because children with AS are frequently unable to express their fears and
anxieties, it is up to significant adults to make it worthwhile for them to leave their
safe inner fantasy lives for the uncertainties of the external world.  Professionals who
work with these youngsters in schools must provide the external structure, organization,
and stability that they lack.  Using creative teaching strategies with individuals 
suffering from Asperger syndrome is critical, not only to facilitate academic success, but
also to help them feel less alienated from other human beings and less overwhelmed by the
ordinary demands of everyday life.
