<p class="article-woff">Asperger's makes people see the world in a different way, which is
no bad thing, writes Fran Molloy.</p>
<bod>
	</bod><p>People with Asperger's Syndrome - a developmental disorder on
the autistic spectrum - may seem socially odd and they may have
difficult relationships with their partners, children and parents,
but they're in good company.</p>
<p>Director Steven Spielberg has been diagnosed with AS. Einstein
probably had it. Researchers speculate that Mozart, Michelangelo
and Andy Warhol may have had Asperger's traits. Bill Gates also
seems to have some AS traits.</p>
<p>"Most of the major advances in science and art have been made by
people with Asperger's, from Mozart to Einstein," says Dr Tony
Attwood, a Brisbane-based world authority on the disorder. He
describes AS as a different way of thinking.</p>
<p>Characteristics of Asperger's can include an exceptionally good
memory, a very literal and blunt communication style, difficulty in
understanding non-verbal cues, narrow special interests which can
become obsessive and strong adherence to routines and order.</p>
<p>Those with AS often don't experience some of the classic
symptoms of autism - such as learning difficulties and language
delays - but do have difficulty with social skills and
communication. Clumsiness is another common trait.</p>
<div id="adSpotIsland" class="islandad"><small>Advertisement</small><iframe style="width: 300px; height: 600px;" src="Syndrome%20for%20success_files/adtypedoubleislandisiframeyesdomainsmh.htm" name="nameid73223" id="nameid73223" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="250" scrolling="no" width="300"></iframe><small>Advertisement</small></div><p>The disorder was named in 1981 after the Austrian pediatrician
Hans Asperger, who in 1944 wrote about a pattern of behaviour and
abilities in four boys. These included "a lack of empathy, little
ability to form friendships, one-sided conversation, intense
absorption in a special interest and clumsy movements".</p>
<p>Asperger nicknamed these children "little professors" because
they would talk about a favourite subject in great detail.</p>
<p>However, although Asperger's work was published in 1944, it
wasn't translated into English until 1991. And only in 1994 was AS
categorised as a disorder.</p>
<p>Autism Spectrum Australia (ASPECT) estimates that about 1 in 154
Australians has some degree of autism, including AS.</p>
<p>As the condition has become better known, more cases are
identified. "There has been a marked increase in diagnosis in the
last five years," says Anthony Warren, director of Outreach
Programs at ASPECT. "It's quite a serious disorder and has a huge
impact on people's lives."</p>
<p>Attwood believes Asperger's has always been around. "Now we've
got a name to describe the pattern of abilities."</p>
<p>Judy Singer is the co-ordinator of ASPAR, a support group for
the adult children of a parent with Asperger's Syndrome. Singer's
mother has AS - something Singer only realised when her own
daughter was diagnosed.</p>
<p>"Medical classification systems have finally caught up with
something that every six-year-old schoolyard bully has been able to
diagnose at sight since time immemorial," Singer writes on her
website, describing Asperger's as the "nerd's disorder". Asperger's
support groups and rights groups abound on the internet, where some
"Aspies" (as they're fondly known) decry the persecution they have
suffered at the hands of non-autistic people, whom they call
"neurotypicals" or "NTs".</p>
<p>Males are diagnosed autistic about three times more often than
females.</p>
<p>Simon Baron-Cohen, professor of developmental
psychopathology</p>
<p>at Cambridge University, describes autism as an extreme version
of the male brain. He says there are innate differences in the
wiring of male and female brains - the male brain understands and
builds systems, while females are wired for empathy.</p>
<p>Leigh Michel, an AS-diagnosed support worker with peer support
group AUT-Support, agrees with Baron-Cohen's assessment. "The
complaints I have about neurotypical people probably sound like
those stereotyped complaints you hear men make about women - they
are unpredictable, they are fickle and they are emotional!"</p>
<p><b>SCHOOLYARD TRAUMA</b></p>
<p>Many people with Asperger's say they feel like they are aliens -
and they are often treated that way in the schoolyard. Many people
with AS find school a nightmare.</p>
<p>"We moved a lot when I was a kid, because my dad was a bank
manager," says Matthew Di Sessa, an AS-diagnosed man living in
Innisfail, Queensland. "I was thrown into the deep end, not knowing
what I had. School was very hard, I was always picked on.
Always."</p>
<p>Peter Norris (see box), recently diagnosed, had similar
experiences. "At school, there was a pecking order - the school
bully was at the top, and I was always at the bottom," he says.</p>
<p>Increased awareness by early childhood specialists, teachers and
child psychologists has led to the identification of many more
children with Asperger's. Early intervention can give them
strategies to learn the confusing rules of the world they
inhabit.</p>
<p>Leigh Michel says children with severe autism can also improve
along the autism spectrum as they grow up and by their early 20s -
when their brains are fully developed - many would fit the category
of Asperger's.</p>
<p>Researchers debate the difference between what is referred to as
high-functioning autism and Asperger's syndrome.</p>
<p>"Most of the diagnoses made today are children. But these
children grow up to be adults, and there are literally thousands of
adults out there struggling who have no idea that they have a
reason for this," Attwood says.</p>
<p>Many people with AS get married, have children, get jobs and
often go through their lives without a clue that there is a reason
behind the stress they endure in everyday life.</p>
<p><b>GETTING THE DIAGNOSIS</b></p>
<p>"Diagnosis will make a huge difference to an adult with AS. When
I speak with people who have just been diagnosed, I say - 'This is
new information, is this helpful to you?' And they almost
invariably say that it is enormously helpful," Attwood says.</p>
<p>The main difference diagnosis makes for those with AS is that
people close to them will now understand the challenges that they
face, he says.</p>
<p>For Leigh Michel, diagnosis of AS gave her the chance to make
sense of her past. "Finally, I had an explanation for why other
people behaved the way they did," she says. "I had above-average
intelligence and I just could not make sense of my alienated
situation until I knew that I had AS."</p>
<p>Di Sessa, diagnosed at 23, says the discovery had a big impact.
"Growing up was difficult, absolutely. The diagnosis explained a
lot. I understood why I like the sort of things that I like."</p>
<p>Leigh Michel says misunderstandings cause difficulties in the
relationship between people with AS and their families and
partners. "People with AS think differently," she says. "It's
actually a cultural difference."</p>
<p>While Michel agrees diagnosis is usually very helpful, she
cautions that it might lead to pathologising the AS person and
absolve their non-autistic partners or families of responsibility
for finding common ground in the relationship.</p>
<p><b>FAMILY MATTERS</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;Carol Grigg is the founder of a support group called
GRASP- for the partners of people with AS.</p>
<p>"The people who come to this group are often in a terrible
state, at desperation point," she says. "Less than half in the
group have a diagnosed partner, because often the person with AS is
so resistant to any suggestion that there is a problem with
them."</p>
<p>Grigg says the group meets to support each other and to learn
strategies to cope with having a relationship with an AS person.
She believes it can help to keep marriages together.</p>
<p>Judy Singer describes her own childhood as "hellish",
remembering her mother as an embarrassing oddball who seemed
incredibly selfish.</p>
<p>Her mother was prone to detailed monologues about her special
interests, without realising no one was interested. Other traits
included obsessive hoarding of old magazines and bus tickets.</p>
<p>"Realising that she had AS - even though she has never been
diagnosed - has completely changed the way I feel about my mother,"
Singer says. "Now I realise how difficult life was for her, I
actually have a lot of admiration for her. And finally, we have a
warm relationship."</p>
